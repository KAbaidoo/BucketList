# BucketList
An app that helps people find fun things to do.

## Description
This is an attempt at implementing the results of a capstone project carried out by 
[Eunifred Asante](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunifred-asante-bediako-a90627189/)
who used [IBM's Design Thinking Framework](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework) 
tool in solving the problem people have finding leisure activities to do, based on their interests. 
The results is a platform composed of two android apps, a [users app](https://github.com/KAbaidoo/BucketList)
to find activities and [another for curators](https://github.com/KAbaidoo/bucketList-curator) of activities. 

The app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) as a backend including:
[Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to signup and validate users, 
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for the main database 
and [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) for file storage. The app works on 
 phones running Android version 5.0 (API level 21) and above.

Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future?
