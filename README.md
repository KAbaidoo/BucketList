# BucketList
An app that helps people find fun things to do.

## Description
This is an attempt at implementing the results of a capstone project carried out by 
[Eunifred Asante](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunifred-asante-bediako-a90627189/)
who used [IBM's Design Thinking Framework](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework) 
tool in solving the problem of finding leisure activities to do, based on their interests. 
The results is a platform composed of two android apps; [BucketList](https://github.com/KAbaidoo/BucketList)
to find activities and [BucketList curators app](https://github.com/KAbaidoo/bucketList-curator) of activities.
The BucketList app enables users to onboard, find interesting activities and make bookings for these events.

The app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) as a backend including:
[Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to signup and validate users, 
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for the main database 
and [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) for file storage. 
QR encoding was implemented with [Zebra Crossing](https://zxing.github.io/zxing/library) library.
The app works on phones running Android version 5.0 (API level 21) and above.
